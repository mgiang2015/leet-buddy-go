# Leet Buddy Go

A CRUD terminal application written in Golang to keep track of my LeetCode progress. This is also for me to apply what I have learnt in my software engineering modules (**CS2103T** and **CS3203**) to develop an application from scratch.

## Run locally

1. Install go

With homebrew (requires [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)): `brew install go` 

Or download it directly from [Golang website](https://go.dev/doc/install)

2. Verify go installation

`go version`

3. Run the application

`go run main.go`

## Commands to run

Commands will be updated soon :)
